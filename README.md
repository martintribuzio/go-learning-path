# Go Learning Path

This is a repository that I've created to learn Go. I'll be collecting all the resources that I'm using to learn each topic, and I'll also include some practical projects that I've created to put into practice what I'm learning.

## Project Goals

My goals with this project are:

- To learn the fundamentals of Go.
- To master the more advanced concepts of Go.
- To be able to create practical projects.
- To share my knowledge with other developers who are also interested in learning this programming language.

## Repository Structure (WIP)

- `Fundamentals of Golang`: Folder with resources to learn the fundamentals of Golang.

## Resources

In the folder for each topic, you'll find a list of resources that I've used to learn. Here are some of the resources that I've found particularly helpful:

- [Go web](https://go.dev/): Go official website.
- [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/): This website is an excellent way to learn Go through practical examples.
- [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1): Interactive tutorial to learn Go.
- [Learn Go Programming](https://golangr.com): You will find materials and exercises. Learn to write code by example.
